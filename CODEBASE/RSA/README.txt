Since I don't have any expertise in RSA i referred to some of the online resources and have coded accordingly to the best of my knowledge

1. Python file - rsa_keypair.py
2. Random input file which contains the data taken from random.org - random_alphanum.txt
3. Output file where the bitmap image is stored - id_rsa.pub
4. Dependencies - random, sys
5. Running the python code to generate the RSA key pair:
      python rsa_keypair.py random_alphanum.txt

P. S: Coded and test on python 3.5
