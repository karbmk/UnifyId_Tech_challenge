# UnifyId_Tech_challenge
Designing different modules based on random numbers

This Project contains 3 main modules from the Technical challenge by UnifyId

1. Generating a RGB bitmap image from random numbers generated using random.org whose code can be found in CODEBASE/RGB
2. Generating a 3 seconds wav sound using the numbers generated using random.org whose code can be found in CODEBASE/WAV
3. Generating a RSA key pair using the string generator from random.org whose code can be found in CODEBASE/RSA
